# Morressier_Technical_Task

There are two models that we'd like you to build (the first one required, the second one nice to have) using the WineEnthusiast reviews dataset hosted at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
1) We would like you to build a model, that with the wine review as input, predicts the sommelier's identity as the output.
2) As a nice to have, please build a model that generates a review based on the sommelier's identity. Feel free to use a pre-trained language model for this one.

We'd like to know your reasoning behind the model choices you make in full detail, including your evaluation and validation methods, and alternative choices (if any) that you ruled out and their corresponding rationale. Feel free to send a package with a README with instructions of how to run it, or simply a jupyter notebook that I can just run on my laptop.
